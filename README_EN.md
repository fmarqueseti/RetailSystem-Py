# RetailSystem-Py

**RetailSystem-Py** is an educational sales and inventory management system developed in Python. This project was built as part of the course *"Python from Beginner to Advanced + Artificial Intelligence"*, taught by **Caio Sampaio** from the **Pythonando** platform.

The system offers two versions:
- Text-based interface (console mode)
- Graphical interface using **Tkinter** – *Under development*

Additionally, it integrates with a MySQL relational database.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Practice core and advanced Python programming concepts
- Integrate relational databases with Python applications
- Apply best practices such as code modularization and internationalization

## 🧠 Database Structure

The system uses a MySQL relational database with the following main entities:

- **Product**: Product registration with name, ingredients, category, and price
- **Order Item**: Sales record of undelivered items
- **Order History**: Historical sales records of delivered items
- **User**: Access control and authentication

The `schema.sql` script located in the `doc` directory can be used to create and populate the database with sample data.

---

## ⚙️ Business Rules

- Product registration, update, and removal, organized by category
- Sales tracking with delivery status updates
- Sales statistics by revenue and quantity (via charts)

---

## 🌐 Internationalization

The system has been fully adapted to the **English** language, including:
- Complete translation of menus and system messages
- Renaming of database fields and structures
- Standardization of filenames and module names in English

---

## 🧩 Requirements

To run the system, the following Python packages must be installed:

```bash
pip install pymysql matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Text-based Interface:

```bash
cd src/txt
python3 myERP.py
```

Make sure your MySQL database is configured and accessible. Use the `schema.sql` script to set it up.
